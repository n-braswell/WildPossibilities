# Modal Cognition in Rhesus Macaques - Open Science Repository

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and procedure demonstration videos for our study on modal cognition in nonhuman primates.

## Experiments Overview
We conducted **four experiments** that systematically examine how macaques track and distinguish representations of certainty and mere possibility.

### **Experiment 1: 3 (minus one) cup task**
- **Goal**: Test whether macaques prefer a guaranteed reward over a potentially rewarding location.  
- **Procedure**:  
  - Macaques were shown a reward hidden in one cup (certain reward).  
  - On the other side, two cups were presented, but only one contained a reward. The other contained a rock. 
  - Before choosing, one of the cups on the paired-cup side was removed.  
- **Key Question**: Can macaques differentiate between a certain and a possible reward?  
- **Results**: Macaques overwhelmingly preferred the certain reward, performing significantly above chance.  


### **Experiment 2: Controlling for Minimal Representation**  
- **Goal**: Test whether macaquesâ€™ performance in Experiment 1 was due to simply guessing the location of a hidden reward.  
- **Procedure**:  
  - Instead of a possible reward, a guaranteed non-reward (a rock) was placed in one cup.  
  - If macaques were guessing in Experiment 1, accuracy should improve.  
- **Key Question**: Do macaquesâ€™ choices reflect an understanding of modal contrast, or were they just guessing about the location of the apple on the paired-cup side?  
- **Results**: Performance remained stable, ruling out the possibility that subjects were merely simulating one possible location.


### **Experiment 3: Avoidance vs. Modal Reasoning**  
- **Goal**: Rule out procedural artifacts or avoidance heuristics driving behavior in Experiments 1 and 2.  
- **Procedure**:  
  - The guaranteed reward on the single-cup side was replaced with a non-reward (a rock).  
  - The only remaining possibility for a reward was on the uncertain side.  
- **Key Question**: Would macaques switch their preference and now choose the side with possible rewards?  
- **Results**: Macaques **preferred the possible reward**, confirming they were not simply avoiding objects like the rock.


### **Experiment 4: The Challenge of Representing Absence**  
- **Goal**: Test whether macaquesâ€™ success in the first three experiments was due to the removal of an empty cup as a possibility.  
- **Procedure**:  
  - Reintroduced an empty cup as an option in the 3-cup setup.  
  - Tested whether macaques could still choose correctly when the uncertain side could contain either a reward or nothing.  
- **Key Question**: Can macaques reason about an empty possibility, or does this challenge their ability to contrast certain vs. possible rewards?  
- **Results**: Performance dropped to **chance level**, suggesting that macaques struggle when required to consider the possibility of an empty location.
